## Domestic cats (_Felis catus_) fed a dry kibble diet have a distinct microbial composition linked to metabolic disease from those fed a wet canned diet

**Scientific Abstract**
<br>A reanalysis of the KittyBiome 16S V4 amplicon dataset using advanced techniques confirms that diet formulation type is a significant factor affecting the microbiome of domestic cats (_Felis catus_).  We found significant differences in the microbial composition between cats reported to be fed at least some portion of their diet as dry kibble and those that received no dry kibble. Cats on dry kibble diets had an enrichment of _Prevotella_ and _Megamonas_ ASVs. These genera have been linked to carbohydrate catabolism and metabolic disease. In addition, there was a depletion of _Amedibacillus_ ASVs, which is a genus known to produce anti-inflammatory short chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate. These findings suggest a strong influence of diet on the feline gut microbiome, with potential implications for feline health. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying these associations and to identify dietary strategies to promote a healthy gut microbiome in cats.

**Non-Academic Summary**
<br>Just like humans, cats have a unique community of bacteria living in their guts. Using new advanced techniques, we re-analyzed a previous dataset and found that the types of gut bacteria present in the feces of healthy cats was strongly influenced by whether they ate dry food or canned wet food. Cats who ate mostly dry food had more bacteria that are good at breaking down carbohydrates and fiber. These bacteria are also associated with metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. This discovery suggests that the type of food we feed our cats can impact not only their gut health but also their overall health. By understanding the connection between diet, gut bacteria, and health we can start making diets that improve long term feline health.
